Project Title:

Advanced File Encryption and Decryption using AES-256

Project Overview:

In todayâ€™s digital world, protecting sensitive information is extremely important. This project aims to help users secure their personal or confidential files so that even if the file is stolen, the data inside remains protected.

This tool allows the user to:

Encrypt a file so it becomes unreadable to anyone without the password.
Decrypt a previously encrypted file back to its original readable form using the correct password.
The encryption process is done using the AES-256 algorithm, a military-grade encryption standard.

Technologies & Libraries Used:

Python

cryptography Python library (for AES encryption)

Colab

Features:

Encrypt any .txt file.
Strong password protection using AES-256.
Easily decrypt the file using the same password.
If the password is incorrect, the decryption fails to protect your data.

Working:

Upload a text file (4.txt) with any content you want to protect.

Run the encryption code by providing a password. The tool will generate an encrypted file.

To read the original file, run the decryption code and enter the correct password. The original content will be restored.

Output:
I have attached two types of screenshots.
